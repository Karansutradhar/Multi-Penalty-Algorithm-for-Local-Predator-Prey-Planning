# Multi-Penalty-Algorithm-for-Local-Predator-Prey-Planning
The goal of this project is to implement a simple and shallow path planner for the predator prey problem. Method: Path planning algorithm similar to A* and potential fields

Instructions to run the program:

first run Algorithm_Functions.py
then run Multi_Penalty_Algorithm.py

Note: If any changes are made to Algorithm_Functions.py it must be re-run before running Multi_Penalty_Algorithm.py
